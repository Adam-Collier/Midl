It was very indicative of our process at Work & Co where we had a focused amount of time concepting, prototyping, and testing ideas. Some of them are far out and crazy, which is how we pushed for a new navigation for Marriott's app. Because the app automatically adjusts based on context—say you're planning a trip or you're checked in to a stay—we opted not to have a traditional home screen or navigation. Instead, you land on the most relevant section and can cycle through the rest using a single button. It's hard to describe (which is why we prototype), but once used in context it is really intuitive and ownable for Marriott.
